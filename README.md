## 📜 Manifesto

A whisper sent, a thought expressed,

On digital winds, where truths are met,

A thousand threads, a silent seed,

free to watch, free to read.

-
For kinship formed on common ground,

Treasures lost and knowledge found,

A chain of trust, a bond of pain,

To future builds, on web of light.

-
Rise, people, unbound and bold,

push back against all evils old,

Greedy foes who seek to bind,

Can't enslave the human mind.

-
They claim the map, they own the road,

they weigh our messages, crush our words,

So shall the fight for freedom being -

join the united federation of jellyfin

☭
